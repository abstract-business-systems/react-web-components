# TODO

* Introduce date range picker component.
* Structure should be discuss - `tab, drawer`
* Remove unwanted `eslint` disabled.
* Change the implementation of menu component.
* The `react-qr-reader` package for the QR scanner is not compatible with React 18, so it has been removed.

## Note

* Material UI has dateRange picker but available in pro version.
* Need to search a library for this component.
